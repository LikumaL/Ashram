October 3 is the anniversary of the death of St Francis of Assisi, also known as the Poverello of Assisi.

He’s among the most loved Saints, remembered on 4 October. For over 800 years Saint Francis of Assisi has been a beacon for the Church through his witness to the Gospel earning him the name alter Christus, a living icon of Christ, his choice to live in poverty in order to encounter the Lord.  

St. Francis who searched for the real foot prints of Jesus Christ and therefore the Holy Mother Church named him ‘The Second Christ’. In the holy gospels he found the real way to Jesus Christ and chosen the very gospel as his rule of life.
