We the Capuchins trace our heritage back 800 years to the little poor man of Assisi, called St. Francis who searched for the real foot prints of Jesus Christ and therefore the Holy Mother Church named him ‘The Second Christ’.We live in fraternity, We pray individually and in common, We share meals and time together, helping one another to grow, as in a family. Our communities, which we call fraternities, are places of joy and hospitality.

We are an evangelical fraternity. Jesus of Nazareth is our guide in leading a simple and humble life in the midst of the people around us. Our inspiration comes from the life of Christ, Sacred Scripture, and the example and writings of St. Francis of Assisi.

Jesus invites us to preach the Gospel, first of all with the example of our lives, and in many practical ways : prayer and contemplation, pastoral work, social service, assistance, missionary activity, publications and information..
